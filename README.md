You then need to store your API key in your `.synonymrc` file.  

## Installation

#### Using Homebrew

  && brew install synonym
```

#### Manual install

To run synonym you will need to install 
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download) 
```sh
brew install jq          # macos
sudo apt-get install jq  # debian / ubuntu
```

    -P /usr/local/bin && sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/synonym
```

### Config file
You will need to create a .synonymrc config file in one of the 
location below.  
```sh
# Possible config file locations (in order of priority)

$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.synonymrc
~/.config/.synonymrc
~/.synonymrc
```

In this file, you can chose a default language and you will need to 
input your API key.

```sh
# .synonymrc example

# API KEY https://thesaurus.altervista.org/mykey
SYNONYM_THESAURUS_KEY=<API KEY>

# Default language
# List of languages supported:
#   en, fr, cs, el, es, da, de, hu,
#   it, no, pl, pt, ro, ru, sk
SYNONYM_SEARCH_LANG=en
```
Note: if no language is set in .synonymrc, or specified in parameters,
the default language will be fetched from the os (`$LANGUAGE` or
